    gpp is nan when 2nd step. Acan1 and Acan2 is NaN. Aleaf is [NaN, NaN].
    Vcmxx is NaN
    scalex is NaN
    extkn  is nan
    FLAIT is 0 --> 1/FLAIT --> extkd is NaN
    LAI is 0 --> FLAIT is 0
    SLA is 0 --> LAI is 0
    SLAx is read from parameter file, but it is confused that SLA and SLAx. change the read varible from SLA to SLAx.
    now, bmleaf is NAN, OutC(2:) is -infinity or NAN.
    change :
        tauC           = (/tau_L,tau_W,tau_R,tau_F,tau_C,tau_Micr,tau_Slow,tau_Pass/)*8760.
    to : 
        TauC           = (/Tau_Leaf,Tau_Wood,Tau_Root,Tau_F,Tau_C,Tau_Micro,Tau_slowSOM,Tau_Passive/)*8760.
    
    However, gpp is always zero.
    Acan1 is zero
    fslt, Aleaf(1) is zero
    extKb is 100
    coszen is error. doy is not be defined?

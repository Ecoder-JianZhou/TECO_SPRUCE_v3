20221209:
    gpp is nan when 2nd step. Acan1 and Acan2 is NaN. Aleaf is [NaN, NaN].
    Vcmxx is NaN
    scalex is NaN
    extkn  is nan
    FLAIT is 0 --> 1/FLAIT --> extkd is NaN
    LAI is 0 --> FLAIT is 0
    SLA is 0 --> LAI is 0
    SLAx is read from parameter file, but it is confused that SLA and SLAx. change the read varible from SLA to SLAx.
    now, bmleaf is NAN, OutC(2:) is -infinity or NAN.
    change :
        tauC           = (/tau_L,tau_W,tau_R,tau_F,tau_C,tau_Micr,tau_Slow,tau_Pass/)*8760.
    to : 
        TauC           = (/Tau_Leaf,Tau_Wood,Tau_Root,Tau_F,Tau_C,Tau_Micro,Tau_slowSOM,Tau_Passive/)*8760.
    
    However, gpp is always zero.
    Acan1 is zero
    fslt, Aleaf(1) is zero
    extKb is 100
    coszen is error. doy is not be defined? something wrong in cycle process?
    hour is not defined, now coszen is correct
    but, Acan1 is still zero. Aleaf(1) is zero
    photosyn input and ouput have probelms. Now, the Aqc Aqx from ciandA is error.
    CiandA, VcmxT is error because of input in VJtemp: Tlf is error.
    before photosyn, Gbc, fwsoil and Vcmxx is different
    Vcmxx is error because of the input part, it misfixes the Vcmx0 and Vcmax0
    Tsoil_simu add, shcap is NaN, wcl
    evap is NaN, Rsoilabs, G is NaN
    liq_water, ice is NAN.  sftmp is Nan first, then delta from resdh= Rsoilabs-Hsoil-Esoil-G
    Rsoilabs and Esoil is NAN, Esoil is from Rsoilabs, Rsoilab3 is NAN, QLleaf is NAN
    Tleaf1 is culculative each cycle
    ===========================================================================================
    1 Ra is different, Rh is different, GPP is different from 53.
    Rh is cumulative....
    --------------------
    check Ra first. 
    Ramain is first different, RmStem, RmRoot are different. Rmstem is RS0 and StemSap, Rs0 must not change but change because plantgrowth confused use Rs0
    StemSap must change but not change, becuase daily update not put in daily but each cycle.
    Rmroot is different or not ? yes it solved
    --------------------
    check Rh
    for Rh_pools(1) OUTC(1) --> S_T -->tsoil_layer testout is re-defined in Tsoil_simu module
    Rh is still different when gpp is higher ...NO from the 2nd simulation is differetn
    S_omega has slightly different, omega,
    real(kind=8) FLDCAP, WILTPT_x  ! Jian: use WILTPT_x replace the WILTPT
    step 100: S_t(1) change, still tsoil_layer, 
    sftmp, Tsoill(1), Tsnow, all different
    -----
    check sftmp
    delta and resdh, from G, snow_depth_t is different
    snow_d() not work.

    bugs: spinup to zero gpp
    Acan is 0,  Aleaf is 0, Aleafx is 0, Vcmxx is too low, Vcmx0, SNvcmax is too low, CN(1) is too low
    ------------------------
    something is wrong, maybe Aleafx is updated in photosyn subroutine.
    Aleafx = (amin1(Acx, Aqx) - Rd)
    Aqx is zero, maybe Gma =0, maybe ej = 0, eJmxT too low, eJmxx too low, eJmx0 is low, Vcmx0 is low, SNvcmax is low, CN(1) low
    N_leaf is error too low, NSN is too low??
    QC1 higher, QN1 not so higher.
    NPP is error, GrowthP is zero, NPP == add, because GPmax*fnsc*St*(1.-exp(-NSN)) is error
    ===================
    946 times, it also error in Aleafx
